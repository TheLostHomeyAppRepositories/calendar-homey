# IcalCalendar

The IcalCalendar gives Homey flow cards to trigger on your calendar events

## Test tool

A separate [test tool is created](https://github.com/runely/calendar-homey-test) for you to test IcalCalendar behavior in your own console

## Setup

- Open settings (configure app)
    - Paste in the ical link and give it a name
    - Change the date/time format or use the default (your choice)
        - All tokens supported in **moment.format()** is also supported here: https://momentjscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moment/04-displaying/01-format/
    - Choose the timeframe for how many events to sync in to the app
    - Choose whether or not you want **next event tags** per calendar. Default is off

### Find Exchange Online ical link

1. Go to https://outlook.office.com/mail/inbox
1. Click settings -> Show all outlook setting
1. Go to Calendar -> Shared calenders
1. Publish a calendar, click the ics link and choose copy
1. Paste the ical link in settings of Homey app

### Find Gmail ical url

1. Go to https://calendar.google.com/
1. Click the three dots next to the calendar you want to share -> Click Settings and sharing
1. Scroll all the way down to the bottom
1. Copy the link from Secret address in ical format
1. Paste the ical link in settings of Homey app

### Find Apple iCloud url

> The first 2 standard Apple iCloud calendars (**Home** and **Work**) are not available to be shared by a public link but only by personal invite (via email). Only **new** and **non-default** calendars from Apple iCloud are working through the public link.

1. Go to https://www.icloud.com/calendar/, or open the Calendar app on your iOS device
1. Click on the icon next to the calendar name in the left pane (not **Home** or **Work**)
1. Tick the checkbox for **Public calendar**
1. Copy the link
1. Paste the calendar link in the Homey app settings
    - **It must be the original link (*Apple Calendar has case sensitive urls*)**

### Add device `IcalCalendar`

Add the `IcalCalendar` device to follow along with how many calendars you have configured, total event count for all your calendars, and last synchronization timestamp and event count per calendar configured.

### Timezone in your calendar (*.ics)

:exclamation:
The library used in this app to parse the calendars, **[node-ical](https://github.com/jens-maus/node-ical)**, does `NOT` use the `X-WR-TIMEZONE` property to parse timezones. Instead it uses the `BEGIN:VTIMEZONE` sections to parse timezones!

:exclamation:
This means that if your calendar provider only uses the `X-WR-TIMEZONE` property, this app will assume your events is always in UTC!

:exclamation:
If your events are created with the timezone `Customized Time Zone` (you will see this when opening the .ics file in a text editor), the events are most likely created with the correct datetime and should not have a timezone applied. The local timezone will Therefore `NOT` be applied to these events!

## Usage

### Sync
- Events are fetched **automatically every 15th minute** (xx:00, xx:15, xx:30, xx:45)
- The following events will be fetched in to the app:
    - Events not started yet where start date is within the timeframe given in the setup
    - Recurring events where start date is within the timeframe given in the setup
    - Events started but not finished

### See events synced in

To see a list of synced in events, you can use the condition card `Specific event is ongoing` in a flow like this:

1. Create a new flow, *or use an existing one (your choice)*
1. Choose the `Flow` -> `This flow has started` as the trigger in the `WHEN` section
1. In the `AND` section, add the `Specific event is ongoing` card from **IcalCalendar**
    1. Click `Select event...` in the condition card
    1. This will present you with a list of all the events synced in

### Local events

> A local event is **just** local. They will never interact with your calendar externally!

#### Create local event

You can use the action card `Create local event` to add a local event to one of your calendars in Homey. This local event will live and behave just as a normal event would.<br />
When the event is finished, it will automatically be removed, just as any other event.

:exclamation:
If you set `Apply your timezone` to **True**, this will treat the datetimes given as UTC and your timezone difference will be added!

#### Delete local event by title

You can use the action card `Delete local event by title` to remove any local events containing the **title** given.

### Triggers
- **Event starts** - *will trigger when any event starts*
- **Event starts in** - *will trigger when any event starts in when specified*
- **Event starts from calendar** - *will trigger when any event in specified calender starts*
- **Event ends** - *will trigger when any event ends*
- **Event ends in** - *will trigger when any event ends in when specified*
- **Event ends from calendar** - *will trigger when any event in specified calender ends*
- **Event changed** - *will trigger when any of the previously synchronized events have been changed (after sync)*
- **Event added** - *will trigger when a new event is created in one of your synced calendars*
    - **Will trigger when these requirements are met:**
        - The event has the `CREATED` property
        - The created events start time is inside the current datetime frame beeing synced in
        - The created event is created within the last 24 hours
- **Synchronization error occurred** - *will trigger when a synchronization error occurs with one of your calendars*

#### Calendar providers not using the `CREATED` property

These calendar providers do not use (or at least not for all events) the `CREATED` property, and so the `Event added` trigger will not work for these calendar providers

- **Office 365**

### Conditions
- **Specific event is ongoing** - *will check if specified event is|isn't ongoing*
- **Specific event starts within** - *will check if specified event starts|doesn't start within when specified*
- **Specific event ends within** - *will check if specified event ends|doesn't end within when specified*
- **Any event is ongoing** - *will check if any event is|isn't ongoing*
- **Any event starts within** - *will check if any event starts|doesn't start within when specified*
- **Any event ends within** - *will check if any event ends|doesn't ends within when specified*
- **Any event ongoing in calendar** - *will check if any event is|isn't ongoing in specified calendar*
- **Event containing ... in calendar ... starts within** - *Event containing search value in chosen calendar starts within selected time range (will fill up global tags (containing))*
- **Event containing ... in calendar ... ends within** - *Event containing search value in chosen calendar ends within selected time range (will fill up global tags (containing))*
- **Any event starts within from calendar** - *will check if any event starts|doesn't start within when specified from specified calendar*
- **Event containing ... in calendar ... is ongoing** - *will check if an event containing **value** in **calendar** is|isn't ongoing*
- **Calendar has event where property matches given value and optionally starts within ...** - *will check if specified calendar has one or more events where given property matches|doesn't match given value, and if amount and type is given, also check if event starts within ...*

### Actions
- **Sync calendars** - *will download new .ics files to update current events*
- **Create local event** - *will allow you to create a local event that behaves just as a normal event, but only lives on your Homey* (`event is automatically deleted when it's finished`)
- **Delete local event by title** - *will remove any local events with this title* (`if several local events with this title is found, all of them will be removed!`)
- **Get calendars metadata** - *Will return a JSON representation of your calendar metadata* (`advanced flow action card`)
- **Get calendar event** - *Returns tokens for given event in a given calendar* (`advanced flow action card`)

### HomeyScripts

- **get-all-events**
    - [HP19](homeyscripts/HP19_get-all-events.js)
    - [HP23](homeyscripts/HP23_get-all-events.js)

### Flow tags on triggers
- Event title
- Event description
- Event location
- Event duration
- Event duration *(minutes)*
- Calendar name
- Status
    - Read from **X-MICROSOFT-CDO-BUSYSTATUS** or **MICROSOFT-CDO-BUSYSTATUS**
- Meeting URL
    - Read from **description** for `Microsoft Teams`, `Apple FaceTime`, `Google Meet` and the generic meeting url pattern (----( Video )----\nhttp://meet.url/123-4567-890\n---===---)
- Start date *(only `Event added`)*
- Start time *(only `Event added`)*
- End date *(only `Event added`)*
- End time *(only `Event added`)*
- Calendar error *(only `Synchronization error occurred`)*
- UID *(only `Synchronization error occurred`)*

### Global flow tags (can be used in any app and service)
- Next event title
- Next event start date
- Next event start time
- Next event end date
- Next event end time
- Next event duration
- Next event duration *(minutes)*
- Next event starts in *(minutes)*
- Next event ends in *(minutes)*
- Next event description
- Calendar name of next event
- Todays events, title and time
- Todays events *(count)*
- Tomorrows events, title and time
- Tomorrows events *(count)*
- Todays events *(per calendar)*
- Tomorrows events *(per calendar)*

### Next event tags per calendar (can be turned on in the settings)
- Next event title in %calendarname%
- Next event start date in %calendarname%
- Next event start time in %calendarname%
- Next event end date in %calendarname%
- Next event end time in %calendarname%
- Next event description in %calendarname%

### Next event tags containing
- Title (contains)
- Start date (contains)
- Start time (contains)
- End date (contains)
- End time (contains)
- Description (contains)

> These tags are used together with condition *Event containing ... in calendar ... starts within* `OR` *Event containing ... in calendar ... ends within*.
> If the condition evaluates to **true**, these tags will be filled with the event found, and the tags can be used in any action card

## Recurring events

### Be aware of *multiple/duplicate* "recurring" events:
- On a recurring event, where one or more participants have declined, that specific event is detached from the recurring event and created as a separate non-recurring event. This can result in two similar events, both have the same name and date.
